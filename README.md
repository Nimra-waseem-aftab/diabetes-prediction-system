# Diabetes Prediction System

## Introduction

In today’s rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, early detection of chronic diseases has become increasingly important. Diabetes is one of the most prevalent health conditions worldwide, and timely diagnosis plays a critical role in preventing severe complications and improving patient outcomes. However, identifying individuals at risk can be complex, as it involves analyzing multiple medical indicators simultaneously. This is where data-driven approaches provide significant value. This project focuses on developing an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on key clinical features such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, insulin level, and age. The objective is to leverage predictive analytics to support early risk assessment and demonstrate the practical application of artificial intelligence in healthcare.
