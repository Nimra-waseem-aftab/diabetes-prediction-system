# Diabetes Prediction System

## Overview

The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning–based predictive model designed to estimate the likelihood of diabetes using clinically relevant medical attributes. The project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques in healthcare analytics and emphasizes the importance of early risk detection through data-driven decision-making.
By leveraging structured medical data, the system provides a classification output indicating whether an individual is at risk of developing diabetes. This project reflects the practical integration of artificial intelligence in preventive healthcare solutions.

## Project Objectives

* Implement supervised machine learning algorithms on a healthcare dataset
* Perform comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
* Develop and evaluate multiple classification models
* Compare model performance using standard evaluation metrics
* Build a robust and generalizable predictive system
  
## Dataset Description

The model is trained using medical diagnostic attributes, including:
* Glucose Level
* Blood Pressure
* Skin Thickness
* Insulin Level
* Body Mass Index (BMI)
* Diabetes Pedigree Function
* Age

## Methodology

1. Data Acquisition and Cleaning

   * Identification and handling of missing or zero values
   * Data consistency checks

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   * Statistical summaries
   * Correlation analysis
   * Data visualization

3. Data Preprocessing

   * Feature scaling and normalization
   * Train-test data splitting

4. Model Development

   * Implementation of classification algorithms
   * Model training and validation

5. Model Evaluation

   * Performance comparison using evaluation metrics
   * Selection of the most reliable and generalizable model
   
## Technologies and Tools

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
  
## Model Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is assessed using standard classification metrics:
* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score

## Results

The trained machine learning model achieved strong classification performance, demonstrating reliable accuracy and balanced precision–recall scores on unseen test data. The results indicate that the system can effectively identify individuals at potential risk of diabetes based on key medical attributes.
